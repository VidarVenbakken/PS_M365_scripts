# Microsoft 365 Powershell scripts

This repository contains "nice to have" scripts I regularly use

- Scripts for posting to Teams via webhooks
	- [M365 Health status](https://github.com/einast/PS_M365_scripts/blob/master/M365HealthStatus.ps1)
	- M365 Roadmap updates

Other scripts will follow, as I refine and migrate from my other data stores that contain different scripts.
